# Contributing

Please contribute! I'd love it if you sent me a pull request with some changes. Feel free to add in some open source projects that aren't here (even if it's just Mutable, Music Thing Modular or Ornament and Crime).

If you're going to contribute, please search before you add; it might already be here!
